# Robotic Arm Project

Welcome to the Robotic Arm Sorting project repository! This project is developed for a school subject and involves a robotic arm capable of sorting balls into respective bins. The arm utilizes inverse kinematics for precise movement and incorporates a camera system to detect the color of the sorted objects.

## Getting Started
Open the project in Webots and run the simulation.
